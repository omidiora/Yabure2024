        INTRODUCTION PROBLEMS FACING NIGERIAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM In 2014, a
        report was published online by the CIA World Factbook claiming that
        almost 75% of the world’s 775 million illiterate adults are concentrated
        in ten countries (in descending order: India, China, Pakistan,
        Bangladesh, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Brazil, Indonesia, and the
        Democratic Republic of Congo). The report went further to say that the
        number of literacy rate of Nigeria was 78.6%, 84.4% male literacy rate
        while 72.7% represents the female literacy rate bringing about an 11.7%
        gender disparity. This paper focuses on some of the current problems of
        educational development in Nigeria, namely: (1) The issue of
        responsibility and control of the society’s education: conflict between
        the use of comput- er resources and over emphasis on the need for
        peripherals for e-resources (2) Unstable curriculum and subjects (3) The
        poor state of the nations economy: SAP, FEM and the financing of the
        education system; (4) Procurement and servicing of equipment (5)
        Inadequate classroom accommodation; (6) Poorly equipped libraries,
        laboratories and subject rooms and (7) Scarcity and prohibitive cost of
        books at all levels of education. Access to and availability of
        computers in the university community potentially has influence on the
        use of electronic resources. The research has revealed high levels of
        access to computers connected to the Internet among both academic staff
        and students. The Nigerian education sector is in dire straits, and
        requires both public and private sector intervention, if the country is
        to fulfill its potential as not only a regional powerhouse, but as a
        global player. WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO Numbers is a company whose
        strategy is based on technological innovation. In one of our brainstorm
        meetings we had the idea to create a mobile application which provided
        an opportunity for anybody to have access to learning resources at home,
        in the office etc. at low cost and is easy to implement. We were looking
        for a market segment within mobile applications that was not currently
        served: a hole in the market. We realized there is a lot of hardware
        equipment available on the market but no real interface and remote
        control possibilities with students. The only mobile applications on the
        market that offer such access combine with expensive total installation
        packages by third parties. There were no apps that gave the customers
        the possibility to access to the resources themselves with any kind of
        hardware (smartphones, tablets and web based products), brand
        independent. So we decided to create one: Yabure was born. PRODUCT
        VISION (I) Improve Your Traditional and Digital Collection Help today’s
        students become the best in the world with library software and
        materials that improve liter- acy and build reading comprehension. (II)
        Expand Digital Content and course Management Re-envisioning a library
        for the digital age is incredibly challenging. That’s why we intend to
        create a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate eBook platform. Our eBook
        platform would provide students and teachers with 24/7 access to eBooks
        for easy browsing, and digital media materials vital for classroom
        instruction. (III) Improve Students’ Online Research The exponential
        growth of web resources doesn’t necessarily translate into better online
        research. Having too many online options to choose from can actually
        harm the students’ research quality. (IV) Set and Meet Higher Standards
        The benchmark for keeping nigerian students competitive in today’s world
        is high. By partnering with us and adopting our school library
        resources, you’ll be more than up for the challenge. (V) Make Your
        Library a Learning Hub Collaborative learning should be a focal point
        for contemporary schools and libraries. With the right re- sources,
        school libraries can facilitate cross-communication and enhance
        collaboration between students, teachers, administrators.
